openpiazza
==========

How many times have you ever wanted to send a link to a post on” piazza.com” and not been able to because the recipient doesn’t have login credentials? It makes sense that whatever content a user creates, by adding a post, should be open for public consumption. For instance, StackOverflow.com makes it easy for someone to post a question and then have other users answer it. The same goes for piazza. However, piazza cannot be viewed by someone who does not have a registered account. Our project allows professors to register their class with a piazza demo account. They could then add the ability for the site to login and scrap certain posts that he wants his students to be able to view, without them having to login.



To get this code to work, you must create an application on Google App Engine and upload this repository to it. You will need to name the application "openpiazzacs4414."
